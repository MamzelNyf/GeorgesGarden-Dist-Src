Variables can also be added globally by creating an external JSON or YML file, and adding it to the src/data folder in a project. 
Let's create a file called breakfast.yml:
- eggs
- bacon
- toast
Panini will load in the contents of this YML file as a variable called {{ breakfast }}.
Because it's an array, we can loop through it using Handlebars's {{#each}} helper:
<ul class="breakfast-items">
  {{#each breakfast}}
    <li>{{ this }}</li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>
This code will print three <li>s, one for each item in the file.
